The webcomic https://xkcd.com/1930 contains a [syntax diagram (railroad diagram)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax_diagram) that describes a grammar for generating \"calendar facts\". The website also shows a tooltip, when hovering over the image with the cursor, which adds another sentence at the end of the grammar."
